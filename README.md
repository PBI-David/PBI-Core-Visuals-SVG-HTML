# SVG

This is a collection of Power BI Core Visuals, SVGs and HTML for use in [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).Â All the work is original and where this has been inspired by the work of others, I have pointed this out.

## SVG Chips & Donuts

A simple table that uses an SVG to show a donut as well as demonstrating the use of SVGs nested within HTML nested within SVGs for the display of the chips.

## SVG Slicers

Elevate the slicer user experience by showing how many records will be affected with each selection. Useful when using \* _Sync Slicers_ \* functionality.
